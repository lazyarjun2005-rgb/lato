## Skill Catalog

You have access to a catalog of reusable skills.

The list below is the complete catalog of skills currently available.

You already know:
- each skill's ID
- its name
- its description

You do NOT know the contents of any skill unless you explicitly load it.

If a task would benefit from a skill, call the "load_skill" tool using the skill's ID.

You may freely list or recommend any skill from this catalog without calling the tool.

Only use "load_skill" when you need the full instructions contained in a skill.

Available skills:
